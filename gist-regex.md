# Matching an Email using Regex

The regex we will be looking at in this Gist is used for validating email inputs in a given application. We will dissect this regex: ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/``` into its basic components.

## Summary

Before we get into too much detail about a regex's components, firstly: What is a regex? A "regex", also known as a "regular expression" is a sequence of characters that is used to recognize and match patterns in text. Regex can be used in a lot of ways, some examples including: "find-and-replace" searches; finding data such as emails, phone numbers, usernames, etc. - anything that requires data-matching or searching data can be done easily with regex. In the case of the Regex we will be looking at today, it will be used to match and verify email addresses.
